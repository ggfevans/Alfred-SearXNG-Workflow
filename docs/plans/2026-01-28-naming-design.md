# Naming Design: Seek

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Decided
**Issue:** #43

## Decision

Rename the workflow from "Alfred-SearXNG-Workflow" to **Seek**.

## Rationale

- **Minimal and clean** — One syllable, immediately understood
- **Memorable** — Easy to recommend and remember
- **Professional** — Polished enough for Alfred Gallery
- **Discoverable** — "SearXNG" appears in all descriptions and metadata for search ranking

## Naming Scheme

| Context | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Primary name | Seek |
| GitHub repo | `Seek` |
| GitHub description | "SearXNG search for Alfred — private web search with inline results" |
| GitHub topics | `searxng`, `alfred-workflow`, `alfred`, `search`, `privacy`, `macos` |
| README title | "Seek: Alfred Workflow for SearXNG" |
| Alfred display name | Seek |
| Keywords | `sx` (primary), `seek` (alias) |

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Rename GitHub repository to `Seek`
- [ ] Update GitHub description
- [ ] Add GitHub topics
- [ ] Update README.md title and references
- [ ] Update `info.plist` display name
- [ ] Add `seek` keyword alias
- [ ] Update any documentation referencing old name

## Alternatives Considered

| Name | Style | Why not chosen |
|------|-------|----------------|
| SX | Minimal | Too cryptic, less memorable |
| Scout | Evocative | Good but slightly less direct |
| Prowl | Evocative | Privacy connotation but less clear |
| Ferret | Playful | Fun but less professional |
| SearchX | Descriptive | Too close to "SearXNG", compound names less preferred |
